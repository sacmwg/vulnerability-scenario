    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an automated enterprise vulnerability
        assessment scenario aligned with the SACM Use Cases. The
        scenario assumes the existence of an endpoint management
        capability and begins with an enterprise ingesting
        vulnerability description information. Endpoints are assessed
        against the vulnerability description information based a
        combination of examining known endpoint characterization
        information and collected endpoint information.</t>

    <section title="Assumptions">
      <t>A number of assumptions must be stated in order to further
        clarify the position and scope of this document.</t>
      <t>The document assumes that: <list style="symbols">
          <t>The enterprise has received vulnerability description
            information, and that the information has already been
            processed into vulnerability detection data that the
            enterprise's security software tools can understand and
            use.</t>
          <t>The enterprise has a means of identifying enterprise
            endpoints although assertions about some details of this
            capability are made.</t>
          <t>The enterprise has a means of extracting relevant
            information about enterprise endpoints in a form that is
            compatible with the vulnerability description
            data.</t>
          <t>All information described in this scenario is available
            in the vulnerability description data and serves as the
            basis of this assessment.</t>
          <t>The enterprise can provide all relevant information about
            any endpoint needed to perform the described
            assessment.</t>
          <t>The enterprise has a mechanism for long-term storage of
            vulnerability description information, vulnerability
            detection data, and vulnerability assessment results.</t>
          <t>The enterprise has a procedure for reassessment of
            endpoints at some point after initial assessment. </t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Vulnerability Assessment Pre-requisites">
      <t>In order to successfully support the vulnerability assessment
        scenario, an enterprise needs to have the following
        capabilities deployed on their network and information readily
        available.</t>
      <section title="Endpoint Management Capability">
        <t>An endpoint management capability is assumed to be in place
          within the enterprise, and is expected to collect a minimum
          set of attributes from the endpoints under management, and
          to establish an endpoint's identity within the scope of that
          domain. Endpoint identity can be established by collecting
          certain attributes (as part of the minimum set of
          attributes) that allow for unique and persistent tracking of
          endpoints on the enterprise network. Examples include, but
          are not limited to, IP address, MAC address, Fully Qualified
          Domain Names (FQDNs), pre-provisioned identifiers such as
          Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) or copies of serial
          numbers, certificates, hardware identity values, or similar
          attributes. All of the information collected by the endpoint
          management capability is stored, with appropriate metadata
          (i.e. timestamp), in a central location. The endpoint
          management capability is expected to be performed on an
          ongoing basis, resulting in routine, or even event-driven,
          collection of basic endpoint information.</t>

        <t>See "Data Attribute Tables and Definitions" for
          information-specific details.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Vulnerability Description Information">
        <t> Vulnerability description information is expected to be
          periodically received by the enterprise. Upon receipt, the
          vulnerability description information is expected to be
          assigned a unique tracking identifier, stored in a
          repository (with appropriate metadata) in raw form, and
          transformed into a machine-readable vulnerability detection
          data with unique tracking identifier understood by the
          components described by this scenario. This transformed form
          can be referred to as the vulnerability detection data. At
          some point, receipt and processing of vulnerability
          description data is expected to trigger the vulnerability
          assessment. </t>
        <t>See "Data Attribute Tables and Definitions" for
          information-specific details.</t>
      </section>

    </section>


    <section title="Endpoint Vulnerability Assessment Capability">
      <t>When new vulnerability description information is received by
        the enterprise, affected endpoints are identified and
        assessed. The vulnerability is said to apply to an endpoint if
        the endpoint satisfies the conditions expressed in the
        vulnerability detection data.</t>
      <t>A vulnerability assessment (i.e. vulnerability detection) is
        performed in two steps:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Endpoint information collected by the endpoint management
            capability is examined.</t>
          <t>If the data possessed by the endpoint management
            capability is insufficient, then necessary data is
            collected from the target endpoint.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>Vulnerability detection relies on the examination of
        different endpoint information depending on the nature of a
        specific vulnerability. Common endpoint information used to
        detect a vulnerability includes:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>A specific software version is installed on the
            endpoint</t>
          <t>File system attributes</t>
          <t>Specific state attributes</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>In many cases, the endpoint information needed to determine
        an endpoint's vulnerability status will have been previously
        collected by the Endpoint Management Capability and available
        in a Repository. However, in other cases, the necessary
        endpoint information will not be readily available in a
        Repository and a supplemental collection will be necessary. Of
        course, an implementation of an endpoint management capability
        may prefer to enable operators to perform supplemental
        collection under certain circumstances, even when sufficient
        information can be provided by the endpoint management
        capability (e.g. there may be freshness requirements for
        information). </t>
      <t>Supplemental collection of endpoint information for the
        purpose of vulnerability assessment does not necessarily need
        to be a pull by the vulnerability assessment capability. Under
        certain deployment scenarios, once the necessary detection
        information is known, the information beyond that which is
        available in the endpoint management capability can be pushed
        to the vulnerability assessment capability by the endpoint
        whenever that information changes.</t>

      <t>See "Data Attribute Tables and Definitions" for
        information-specific details.</t>

    </section>
    <section title="Vulnerability Assessment Results">
      <t>Vulnerability assessment results present evaluation results
        along with sufficient context, so that appropriate action can
        be taken. Vulnerability assessment results are ideally stored
        for later use.</t>

        <t>Added an example to vulnerability description data in the
          scope section.</t>
        <t>Added a sentence to clarify vulnerability description data
          definition in the scope section.</t>

        <t>Replaced "vulnerability report" to "vulnerability

          confusion. Similarly, replaced "assessment report" with
          "assessment results".</t>
        <t>Replaced "Configuration Management Database (CMDB)" with
          "Repository" which is SACM's term for a data store.</t>
        <t>Replaced endpoint "Role" with "Purpose" because "Role" is
          already defined in SACM. Also, removed "Function" because it
          too is already defined in SACM.</t>
        <t>Clarified that the document does not try to define a

        <t>Included additional examples of software configuration

        <t>Clarified the section around endpoint identification to
          make it clear designation attributes used to correlate and
          identify endpoints are both persistent and unique.
          Furthermore, text was added to explain how the persistency
          of attributes may vary. This was based on knowledge gained
          from the Endpoint ID Design Team.</t>
        <t>Updated the Security Considerations section to mention
          those described in <xref target="RFC7632"/>.</t>
        <t>Removed text around Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). While
          important, BYOD just adds complexity to this initial draft.
          BYOD should be addressed in a later revision.</t>
        <t>Merged the list of "basic endpoint information" and the
          list of "human-assigned endpoint attributes" as both
          represent data we want to collect about an endpoint. Whether
          or not that data is natively available on the endpoint for
          collection or assigned by a human, computed, or derived from
          other data which may or may not be available on the endpoint
          for collection seems arbitrary. With this scenario, we
          primarily care about expressing information needs rather
          than how the information is collected or from where.</t>

    <section title="Continuous Vulnerability Assessment">
      <t>It is not sufficient to perform a single assessment when
        vulnerability description information is published without any
        further checking. Doing so does not address the possibility
        that the reported vulnerability might be introduced to the
        enterprise environment after the initial assessment completes.
        For example, new endpoints can be introduced to the
        environment which have old software or are not up-to-date with
        patches. Another example is where unauthorized or obsolete
        software is installed on an existing endpoint by enterprise
        users after vulnerability description information and initial
        assessment has taken place. Moreover, enterprises might not
        wish to, or be able to, assess all vulnerability description
        information immediately when they come in. Conflicts with
        other critical activities or limited resources might mean that
        some alerts, especially those that the enterprise deems as
        "low priority", are not used to guide enterprise assessments
        until sometime after the initial receipt.</t>
      <t>The scenario above describes a single assessment of
        endpoints. However, it does not make any assumptions as to
        when this assessment occurs relative to the original receipt
        of the vulnerability description data that led to this
        assessment. The assessment could immediately follow the
        ingestion of the vulnerability description information, could
        be delayed, or the assessment might represent a reassessment
        of some vulnerability description information against which
        endpoints had previously been assessed. Moreover, the scenario
        incorporates long-term storage of collected data,
        vulnerability description information, and assessment results
        in order to facilitate meaningful and ongoing
        reassessment.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Priority">
      <t>Priorities associated with the vulnerability description
        information, assessment results, and any remedy is important,
        but is treated as a separate challenge and, as such, has not
        been integrated into the description of this scenario.
        Nevertheless, it is important to point out and describe the
        use of priorities in the overall vulnerability assessment
        scenario as a separate issue with its own sets of
        requirements.</t>
      <t>Priority in regard to vulnerability description information,
        can be viewed in a couple of different ways within an
        enterprise. The assessment prioritization involves
        prioritization of the vulnerability description information
        assessment process. This determines what vulnerability
        description information is assessed, and in what order it is
        assessed in. For instance, a vulnerability affecting an
        operating system or application used throughout the enterprise
        would likely be prioritized higher than a vulnerability in an
        application which is used only on a few, low-criticality
        endpoints.</t>
      <t>The prioritization of remedies relates to the enterprise
        remediation and mitigation process based on the discovered
        vulnerabilities. Once an assessment has been performed and
        applicable endpoints identified, enterprise vulnerability
        managers must determine where to focus their efforts to apply
        appropriate remedies. For example, a vulnerability that is
        easily exploitable and which can allow arbitrary code
        execution might be remedied before a vulnerability that is
        more difficult to exploit or which just degrades
        performance.</t>
      <t>Some vulnerability description information include severities
        and/or other information that places the vulnerability in
        context. This information can be used in both of the priority
        types discussed above. In other cases, enterprise
        administrators may need to prioritize based only on what they
        know about their enterprise and the description provided in
        the vulnerability description information.</t>
      <t>Examples of data attributes specific to priority of
        assessments and/or remedies include (but not limited to) the
        following:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Enterprise - defined purpose of the device, criticality
            of the device, exposure of the device, etc.</t>
          <t>Severity attributes - A rating or score that attempts to
            provide the level of severity or criticality associated
            with a given vulnerability.</t>
          <t>Cyber threat intelligence - information such as tactics,
            techniques, and procedures of threat actors, indicators of
            compromise, incidents, courses of action, etc. that help
            the enterprise understand relevant threats and how to
            detect, mitigate, or respond to them.</t>

    <section title="Alignment with Other Existing Works">
      <section title="Critical Security Controls">
        <t>The Council on CyberSecurity's <xref
            target="critical-controls">Critical Security
            Controls</xref> includes security controls for a number of
          use scenarios, some of which are covered in this document.
          This section documents the alignment between the Council's
          controls and the relevant elements of the scenario.</t>
        <section title="Continuous Vulnerability Assessment">
          <t>"CSC 4: Continuous Vulnerability Assessment and
            Remediation," which is described by the Council on
            CyberSecurity as "Continuously acquire, assess, and take
            action on new information in order to identify
            vulnerabilities, remediate, and minimize the window of
            opportunity for attackers." The scenario described in this
            document is aligned with CSC 4 in multiple ways:</t>
          <t>CSC 4-1 applies to this scenario in that it calls for
            running regular, automated scanning to deliver prioritized
            lists of vulnerabilities with which to respond. The
            scenario described in this document is intended to be
            executed on a continuous basis, and the priorities of both
            vulnerability description information and the remedy of
            vulnerabilities are discussed in the Priority section
            earlier in this document.</t>
          <t>This scenario assumes that the enterprise already has a
            source for vulnerability description information as
            described in CSC 4-4.</t>
          <t>Both CSC 4-2 and 4-7 are made possible by writing
            information to a Repository since this makes previously
            collected data available for later analysis.</t>
          <t>While this scenario does not go into the details of how
            prioritization would be calculated or applied, it does
            touch on some of the important ways in which
            prioritization would impact the endpoint assessment
            process in the Priority section. As such, the Priority
            section aligns with CSC 4-10, which deals with
            vulnerability priority. Vulnerability priority in this
            scenario is discussed in terms of the vulnerability
            description information priority during receipt, as well
            as the vulnerability priority with regards to
            remedies.</t>
          <t>The described scenario does not address the details of
            applying a remedy based on assessment results. As such,
            CSC 4-5, 4-8, and 4-9, which all deal with mitigations and
            patching, are out of scope for this work. Similarly, CSC
            4-3 prescribes performing scans in authenticated mode and
            CSC 4-6 prescribes monitoring logs. This scenario does not
            get into the means by which data is collected, focusing on
            "what" to collect rather than "how", and as such does not
            have corresponding sections, although the procedures
            described are not incompatible with either of these
            controls.</t>
          <t>The CSC 4 System Entity Relationship diagram and numbered
            steps directly align with the scenario described in this
            document with the exception of step 7 (patch response).
            Steps 1 -6 in CSC 4 describe the overall process for
            vulnerability management starting with obtaining the
            vulnerability description information from the source in
            Step 1, to producing assessment results in Step 6.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Hardware and Software Inventories">
          <t>This scenario is also aligned with, and describes a
            process for, collecting and maintaining hardware and
            software inventories, which are covered by the Council on
            CyberSecurity CSC 1 "Inventory of Authorized and
            Unauthorized Devices" and CSC 2 "Inventory of Authorized
            and Unauthorized Software." This scenario documents a
            process that is specific to collecting and maintaining
            hardware and software data attributes for vulnerability
            assessment purposes, but the collection of the hardware
            attributes and software inventory documented in the
            Endpoint Data Collection section that follows can also be
            used for the purpose of implementing authorized and
            unauthorized hardware and software management processes
            (e.g., scanning tools looking for unauthorized software).
            Moreover, the ability to accurately identify endpoints
            and, to a lesser degree, applications is integral to
            effective endpoint data collection and vulnerability
            management.</t>
          <t>The Endpoint Data Collection section does not have
            coverage for the specific details described in CSC 1 and 2
            as they are different processes and would be out-of-scope
            of this scenario, but the section does provide the data
            necessary to support the controls.</t>
          <t>The Endpoint Identification and Endpoint Data Collection
            sections within this scenario align with CSC 1-1 and 1-4
            by identifying enterprise endpoints and collecting their
            hardware and network attributes. The Endpoint Data
            Collection section aligns with and supports CSC 2-3 and
            2-4 by defining a software inventory process and a method
            of obtaining operating system and file system attributes.
            The rest of the items from CSC 1 and 2 deal with
            implementation details and would be out-of-scope for this
            document.</t>
          <t>CSC 2-9 describes the use of a software ID tag in XML
            format. SWID tags
            (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_19770) would also
            be a possible implementation for the Endpoint Data
            Collection section described in this scenario.</t>

            within their IT environment. Multiple checklists are used
            from different vendors to ensure adequate coverage of all
            IT assets." The usage scenario, as defined in the RFC, is
            targeted at the checklist level and can be interpreted as
            being specific to endpoint configuration. There is mention
            of patch assessment and vulnerability mitigation, but the
            usage scenario could be expanded upon by including
            vulnerability verification. Replacing the idea of a
            checklist in the SACM usage scenario with vulnerability
            would allow the usage scenario to align almost exactly
            with the scenario described in this document. Instead of
            collecting automatable security configuration checklists,
            the enterprise would collect automatable vulnerability
            description information available from the vendor as
            described or possibly from other interested
            third-parties.</t>
          <t>Detection of Posture Deviations (2.2.3) - "An enterprise
            has established secure configuration baselines for each
            different type of endpoint within their IT environment.
            When an endpoint connects to the network, the appropriate
            baseline configuration is communicated to the endpoint.
            Once the baseline has been established, the endpoint is
            monitored for any change events pertaining to the baseline
            on an ongoing basis. When a change occurs to posture
            defined in the baseline, updated posture information is
            exchanged. When the endpoint detects a posture change, an
            alert is generated identifying the specific changes in
            posture." This usage scenario would support the concept of
            endpoints signaling or alerting the enterprise to changes
            in the posture relates to endpoint vulnerabilities in the
            same way that it would for configurations. Replacing the
            idea of a checklist with vulnerability description data
            allows the SACM usage scenario and the scenario described
            in this document to align in their objectives.</t>
          <t>Asynchronous Compliance/Vulnerability Assessment at Ice
            Station Zebra (2.2.5) - "An isolated arctic IT environment
            that is separated from the main university network. The
            only network communications are via an intermittent,
            low-speed, high-latency, high-cost satellite link. Remote
            network admins will need to show continued compliance with
            the security policies of the university, the government,
            and the provider of the satellite network, as well as keep
            current on vulnerability testing." This SACM usage
            scenario describes vulnerability assessment and aligns
            well with the vulnerability scenario described in this
            document. The endpoint assets are identified and
            associated data is published in a Repository.
            Vulnerability description information is collected and
            saved in a Repository as it is released. The vulnerability
            description information is queued for later assessment,
            then the assessment results and vulnerability description
            information are stored after assessment. The only real
            difference in this SACM usage scenario is the timing of
            the assessments. The scenario described within this
            document would have no problems adjusting to the timing of
            this SACM usage scenario or anything similar.</t>

    <section title="SACM Requirements and Charter - Future Work">
      <t>In the course authoring this document, some additional
        considerations for possible future work were noted. The
        following points were taken from the <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-sacm-requirements">SACM
        Requirements</xref>, <xref target="charter-ietf-sacm-01">SACM
          Charter</xref>, and SACM Use Cases (<xref target="RFC7632"
        />) documents and represent work that may be necessary to
        support the tasks or goals of SACM going forward.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>The SACM requirements mentions "Result Reporting" with
            applications but no detail around what the assessment
            results data set should include. In the case of
            vulnerability assessment results, context is important and
            details beyond just a Pass or Fail result are needed in
            order to take action. A good example of this might be the
            Priority of the vulnerability itself and how many systems
            it affects within the enterprise. With this in mind, it
            might be worthwhile to investigate a minimum data set or
            schema for assessment results. The concern here is with
            vulnerability description data, but this could apply to
            other enterprise processes as well.</t>
          <t>The "Human-assigned endpoint attributes" mentioned
            previously in this scenario are touched on in the SACM use
            cases, but the topic could probably be explored in much
            more depth. Enterprise policy and behaviors could be
            greatly influenced by endpoint attributes such as
            locations, how the endpoint is used, and criticality. When
            and how these data attributes are collected, as well as
            what the minimum or common set might look like, would be
            good topics for future related SACM work. In addition, the
            storage of these attributes could be central (stored in a
            data repository) or they could be assigned and stored on
            the endpoints themselves.</t>
