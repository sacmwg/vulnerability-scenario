    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an automated enterprise vulnerability assessment scenario aligned
        with the SACM Use Cases. The scenario assumes the existence of an endpoint management
        capability and begins with an enterprise ingesting vulnerabilty description data. Endpoints
        are assessed against the vulnerability description data based a combination of examining
        known and collected endpoint information.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Scope">
      <t>The purpose of this document is to describe a detailed scenario for vulnerability
        assessment, and identify aspects of this scenario that could be used in the development of
        an information model. This includes classes of data, major roles, and a high-level
        description of role interactions. Additionally, this scenario intends to inform engineering
        work on protocol and data model development. The focus of the document is entirely
        intra-organizational and covers enterprise handling of vulnerability description data. The
        document does not attempt to cover the security disclosure itself and any prior activities
        of the security researcher or discloser, nor does it attempt to cover the specific
        activities of the vendor whose software is the focus of the vulnerability description data
        (i.e., the vulnerable software).</t>

      <t>For the purposes of this document, the term "vulnerability description data" is intended to
        mean: "Data intended to alert enterprise IT resources to the existence of a flaw or flaws in
        software, hardware, and/or firmware, which could potentially have an impact on enterprise
        functionality and/or security." For the purpose of this scenario, such data also includes
        information that can be used to determine (to some level of accuracy, although possibly not
        conclusively) whether or not the flaw is present within an enterprise, when compared to
        information about the state of the enterprise's endpoints. For those who are familiar with
        current security practices and terminology, the use of vulnerability description data is
        also synonymnous with security bulletin or advisory.</t>

      <t>This document makes no attempt to provide a definition of a normalized data format (e.g.
        industry standard) for vulnerability description data although there is nothing precluding
        the development of such a normalized data format. Also, it does not attempt to define
        procedures by which a vulnerability discoverer coordinates the release of vulnerability
        description data to other parties.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Assumptions">
      <t>A number of assumptions must be stated in order to further clarify the position and scope
        of this document.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>The document begins with the assumption that the enterprise has received vulnerability
            description data, and that the data has already been processed into a format that the
            enterprise's security software tools can understand and use. In particular, this
            document: <list style="symbols">
              <t>Does not discuss how the enterprise identifies potentially relevant vulnerability
                description data.</t>
              <t>Does not discuss how the enterprise collects the vulnerability description
                data.</t>
              <t>Does not discuss how the enterprise assesses the authenticity of the vulnerability
                description data.</t>
              <t>Does not discuss parsing of the vulnerability description data into a usable
                format.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>The document assumes that the enterprise has a means of identifying enterprise
            endpoints. This could mean identifying endpoints as they join the network, actively
            scanning for connected endpoints, passive scanning of network traffic to identify
            connected endpoints, or some other method of accounting for the presence of all
            endpoints in the enterprise. The document also does not distinguish between physical
            endpoints and virtualized endpoints.</t>
          <t>The document assumes that the enterprise has a means of extracting relevant information
            about enterprise endpoints. Moreover, this extracted information is expressed in a
            format that is compatible with the information extracted from the vulnerability
            description data. The document: <list style="symbols">
              <t>Does not specify how relevant information is identified.</t>
              <t>Does not specify the mechanics of how relevant information is extracted from the
                data sources (such as the endpoint itself).</t>
              <t>Does not specify how extracted endpoint information and vulnerability description
                data is normalized to be compatible.</t>
            </list>Note that having a means of extracting relevant information about enterprise
            endpoints is within the scope of the SACM Endpoint Security Posture Assessment process.
            In the case of this document, this sub-process is assumed to be existent. </t>
          <t>The document assumes that all information described in the steps below is available in
            the vulnerability description data and serves as the basis of this assessment. Likewise,
            the document assumes that the enterprise can provide all relevant information about any
            endpoint needed to perform the described analysis. The authors recognize that this will
            not always be the case, but these assumptions are taken in order to show the breadth of
            data utilization in this scenario. Less complete information may require variations to
            the described steps.</t>
          <t>The document assumes that the enterprise has a policy by which assessment of endpoints
            based on vulnerability description data is prioritized. The document: <list
              style="symbols">
              <t>Does not specify how prioritization occurs.</t>
              <t>Does not specify how prioritization impacts assessment behaviors.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>The document assumes that the enterprise has a mechanism for long-term storage of
            vulnerability description data and endpoint assessment results (e.g., a data
            repository).</t>
          <t>This document assumes that the enterprise has a procedure for reassessment of endpoints
            at some point after initial assessment. The document: <list style="symbols">
              <t>Does not specify how a reassessment would impact individual assessment behaviors.
                (i.e., it is agnostic as to whether the assessment procedure is the same regardless
                of whether this is the first or a subsequent assessment for some set of
                vulnerability description data.)</t>
              <t>Does not provide recommendations or specifics on reassessment intervals.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Vulnerability Assessment Pre-requisites">
      <section title="Endpoint Management Capability">
        <t>An endpoint management capability is assumed to be in place within the enterprise, and is
          expected to collect a minimum set of attributes from the endpoints under management, and
          to establish an endpoint's identity within the scope of that domain. Endpoint identity can
          be established by collecting certain attributes (as part of the minimum set of attributes)
          that allow for unique and persistent tracking of endpoints on the enterprise network.
          Examples include, but are not limited to, IP address, MAC address, FQDNs, pre-provisioned
          identifiers such as GUIDs or copies of serial numbers, certificates, hardware identity
          values, or similar attributes. All of the information collected by the endpoint management
          capability is stored, with appropriate metadata (i.e. timestamp), in a central location.
          The endpoint management capability is expected to be performed on an ongoing basis,
          resulting in routine, or even event-driven, collection of basic endpoint information.</t>

        <t>See "Data Attribute Tables and Definitions" for information-specific details.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Vulnerability Description Data">
        <t> Vulnerability description data is expected to be periodically received by the
          enterprise. Upon receipt, the vulnerability description data is expected to be assigned a
          unique tracking identifier, stored in a repository (with appropriate metadata) in raw
          form, and transformed into a machine-readable format understood by the components
          described by this scenario. This transformed form can be refered to as the vulnerability
          detection content. At some point, receipt and processing of vulnerablity description data
          is expected to trigger the vulnerability assessment flow. </t>
        <t>See "Data Attribute Tables and Definitions" for information-specific details.</t>
      </section>

    </section>


    <section title="Endpoint Vulnerability Assessment Capability">
      <t>When new vulnerability description data is received by the enterprise, affected endpoints
        just be identified and assessed. The vulnerability is said to apply to an endpoint if the
        endpoint satisfies the conditions expressed in the vulnerablity detection content. </t>
      <t> In general, the process is performed in two steps:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Endpoint informaiton collected by the endpoint management capability is examined.</t>
            <t>If the data possessed by the endpoint management capability is insufficient, then
              sufficient data is collected from the target endpoint.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      

      <t> Vulnerability detection may be done in a number of ways, depending upon the specific
        vulnerability. </t>
      <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>A specific software version is installed on the endpoint</t>
            <t>File system attributes</t>
            <t>Specific state attributes</t>
          </list>
        </t> 
      <t>The breadth of information required to determine an endpoint's vulnerability will
        generally determine whether stored information or targeted collection will be necessary. Of
        course, an implementation may prefer to enable operators to perform targeted collection
        under certain circumstances, even when sufficient information can be provided by the
        endpoint management capability. </t>
      <t>Targeted collection of endpoint information for the purpose of vulnerability assessment
        does not necessarily need to be a pull by the vulnerability assessment mechanism. Under
        certain deployment scenarios, once necessary detection information is known, the information
        beyond that which is available in the endpoint management capability can be pushed to the
        vulnerability assessment capability by the endpoint whenever that information changes.</t>


    </section>
    <section title="Vulnerability Assessment Results">
      <t>Assessment results present the results of an assessment, along with sufficient context so a
        human or machine can take appropriate action. This context might include a description
        of the issue provided by the vulnerability description data, the endpoint attributes that
        indicate applicability, or other information needed to respond to the results of the
        assessment. Vulnerability assessment results are stored for later use.</t>
      <t>The following details are important to track in assessment results. Note that some information
        may be included in assessment results by reference.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Date and time of assessment - The date and time that the assessment was performed. To
            understand when the data was compared against the vulnerability description data and
            what conclusions were drawn.</t>
          <t>Data collection/attribute age - The age of the data used in the assessment to make the
            endpoint status determination.</t>
          <t>Endpoint ID - The endpoint itself must be identified for tracking results over
            time.</t>
          <t>Vulnerability description data ID(s) - May include both the internally defined ID as
            well as one or more externally defined IDs if they exist. The internally assigned ID
            allows linkage to the correct vulnerability description data. If available, external IDs
            provide a "pivot point" to additional external information.</t>
          <t>Vulnerable software product(s) - Identifies the software products on the endpoint that
            resulted in the endpoint being declared applicable. Since some vulnerability description
            data identify vulnerabilities in multiple products, this will help identify the specific
            product (or products) found to be vulnerable in the endpoint assessment.</t>
          <t>Endpoint vulnerability status - The endpoint status based on the vulnerability
            description data. Does the vulnerability exist on the endpoint?</t>
          <t>Vulnerability description reference - Not needed for automated assessment but probably should be
            included for human review. The reason for inclusion is to support the human user
            understanding of the vulnerability assessment results within the application front-end
            or interface.</t>
          <t>Vulnerability remediation - Similar to the above, remediation or vendor patch
            information would be useful for a human response. In many cases, this information may be
            a part of the description information described above. Note that patch information may
            change over time due to supercession of the vendor patches.</t>

        <t>Clarification of the vulnerability description data IDs in sections 4 and 6.</t>
        <t>Added "vulnerability remediation" to the Assessment Results and Data Attribute Table and
          Definitions sections.</t>
        <t>Added Implementation Examples to Endpoint Identification and Initial (Pre-Assessment)
          Data Collection, Vulnerability Description Data, Endpoint Applicability and Assessment,
          and Assessment Results sections.</t>
        <t>Added an example to vulnerability description data in the scope section.</t>
        <t>Added a sentence to clarify vulnerability description data definition in the scope
          section.</t>
        <t>Added data repository example for long-term storage scope item.</t>
        <t>Added sentence to direct reader to examples of basic system information in endpoint
          identification section.</t>
        <t>Split the examples of information to collect in the pre-assessment collection section
          into a basic and advanced list.</t>
        <t>Added examples of data stored in the repository in the Assessment Results section.</t>
        <t>Added sentence for human-assigned attributes in the Future Work section.</t>
        <t>Replaced "vulnerability report" to "vulnerability description data" because the term
          report was causing confusion. Similarly, replaced "assessment report" with "assessment
          results".</t>
        <t>Replaced "Configuration Management Database (CMDB)" with "Repository" which is SACM's
          term for a data store.</t>
        <t>Replaced endpoint "Role" with "Purpose" because "Role" is already defined in SACM. Also,
          removed "Function" because it too is already defined in SACM.</t>
        <t>Clarified that the document does not try to define a normalized data format for
          vulnerability description data although it does not preclude the creation of such a
          format.</t>
        <t>Included additional examples of software configuration information.</t>
        <t>Clarified the section around endpoint identification to make it clear designation
          attributes used to correlate and identify endoints are both persistent and unique.
          Furthermore, text was added to explain how the persistency of attributes may vary. This
          was based on knowledge gained from the Endpoint ID Design Team.</t>
        <t>Updated the Security Considerations section to mention those described in <xref
            target="RFC7632"/>.</t>
        <t>Removed text around Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). While important, BYOD just adds
          complexity to this initial draft. BYOD should be addressed in a later revision.</t>
        <t>Merged the list of "basic endpoint information" and the list of "human-assigned endpoint
          attributes" as both represent data we want to collect about an endpoint. Whether or not
          that data is natively available on the endpoint for collection or assigned by a human,
          computed, or derived from other data which may or may not be available on the endpoint for
          collection seems arbitrary. With this scenario, we primarily care about expressing
          information needs rather than how the information is collected or from where.</t>

    <section title="Continuous Vulnerability Assessment">
      <t>It is not sufficient to perform a single assessment when vulnerability description data is
        published without any further checking. Doing so does not address the possibility that the
        reported vulnerability might be introduced to the enterprise environment after the intial
        assessment completes. For example, new endpoints can be introduced to the environment which
        have old software or are not up-to-date with patches. Another example is where unauthorized
        or obsolete software is installed on an existing endpoint by enterprise users after
        vulnerability description data and initial assessment has taken place. Moreover, enterprises
        might not wish to, or be able to, assess all vulnerability description data immediately when
        they come in. Conflicts with other critical activities or limited resources might mean that
        some alerts, especially those that the enterprise deems as "low priority", are not used to
        guide enterprise assessments until sometime after the initial receipt.</t>
      <t>The scenario above describes a single assessment of endpoints. However, it does not make
        any assumptions as to when this assessment occurs relative to the original receipt of the
        vulnerability description data that led to this assessment. The assessment could immediately
        follow ingest of the vulnerability description data, could be delayed, or the assessment
        might represent a reassessment of some vulnerability description data against which
        endpoints had previously been assessed. Moreover, the scenario incorporates long-term
        storage of collected data, vulnerability description data, and assessment results in order
        to facilitate meaningful and ongoing reassessment.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Priority">
      <t>Priorities associated with the vulnerability description data, assessment results, and any
        remedy is important, but is treated as a separate challenge and, as such, has not been
        integrated into the description of this scenario. Nevertheless, it is important to point out
        and describe the use of priorities in the overall vulnerability description data scenario as
        they separable issues with their own sets of requirements.</t>
      <t>Priority in regard to vulnerability description data, can be viewed in a couple of
        different ways within an enterprise. The assessment prioritization involves prioritization
        of the vulnerability description data assessment process. This determines what vulnerability
        description data is assessed, and in what order it is assessed in. For instance, a
        vulnerability affecting an operating system or application used throughout the enterprise
        would likely be prioritized higher than a vulnerability in an application which is used only
        on a few, low-criticality endpoints.</t>
      <t>The prioritization of remedies relates to the enterprise remediation and mitigation process
        based on the discovered vulnerabilities. Once an assessment has been performed and
        applicable endpoints identified, enterprise vulnerability managers must determine where to
        focus their efforts to apply appropriate remedies. For example, a vulnerability that is
        easily exploitable and which can allow arbitrary code execution might be remedied before a
        vulnerability that is more difficult to exploit or which just degrades performance.</t>
      <t>Some vulnerability description data include severities and/or other information that places
        the vulnerability in context. This information can be used in both of the priority types
        discussed above. In other cases, enterprise administrators may need to prioritize based only
        on what they know about their enterprise and the description provided in the vulnerability
        description data.</t>
      <t>Examples of data attributes specific to priority of assessments and/or remedies include
        (but not limited to) the following:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Enterprise - defined purpose of the device, criticality of the device, exposure of the
            device, etc.</t>
          <t>Severity attributes - A rating or score that attempts to provide the level of severity
            or criticality associated with a given vulnerability.</t>
          <t>Cyber threat intelligence - information such as tactics, techniques, and procedures of
            threat actors, indicators of compromise, incidents, courses of action, etc. that help
            the enterprise understand relevant threats and how to detect, mitigate, or respond to
            them.</t>

        <t>The Council on CyberSecurity's <xref target="critical-controls">Critical Security
            Controls</xref> includes security controls for a number of use scenarios, some of which
          are covered in this document. This section documents the alignment between the Council's
          controls and the relevant elements of the scenario.</t>
        <section title="Continuous Vulnerability Assessment">
          <t>"CSC 4: Continuous Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation," which is described by the
            Council on CyberSecurity as "Continuously acquire, assess, and take action on new
            information in order to identify vulnerabilities, remediate, and minimize the window of
            opportunity for attackers." The scenario described in this document is aligned with CSC
            4 in multiple ways:</t>
          <t>CSC 4-1 applies to this scenario in that it calls for running regular, automated
            scanning to deliver prioritized lists of vulnerabilities with which to respond. The
            scenario described in this document is intended to be executed on a continuous basis,
            and the priorities of both vulnerability description data and the remedy of
            vulnerabilities are discussed in the Priority section earlier in this document.</t>
          <t>This scenario assumes that the enterprise already has a source for vulnerability
            description data as described in CSC 4-4.</t>
          <t>Both CSC 4-2 and 4-7 are made possible by writing information to a Repository since
            this makes previously collected data available for later analysis.</t>
          <t>While this scenario does not go into the details of how prioritization would be
            calculated or applied, it does touch on some of the important ways in which
            prioritization would impact the endpoint assessment process in the Priority section. As
            such, the Priority section aligns with CSC 4-10, which deals with vulnerability
            priority. Vulnerability priority in this scenario is discussed in terms of the
            vulnerability description data priority during receipt, as well as the vulnerability
            priority with regards to remedies.</t>
          <t>The described scenario does not address the details of applying a remedy based on
            assessment results. As such, CSC 4-5, 4-8, and 4-9, which all deal with mitigations and
            patching, are out of scope for this work. Similarly, CSC 4-3 prescribes performing scans
            in authenticated mode and CSC 4-6 prescribes monitoring logs. This scenario does not get
            into the means by which data is collected, focusing on "what" to collect rather than
            "how", and as such does not have corresponding sections, although the procedures
            described are not incompatible with either of these controls.</t>
          <t>The CSC 4 System Entity Relationship diagram and numbered steps directly align with the
            scenario described in this document with the exception of step 7 (patch response). Steps
            1 -6 in CSC 4 describe the overall process for vulnerability management starting with
            obtaining the vulnerability description data from the source in Step 1, to producing
            assessment results in step 6.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Hardware and Software Inventories">
          <t>This scenario is also aligned with, and describes a process for, collecting and
            maintaining hardware and software inventories, which are covered by the Council on
            CyberSecurity CSC 1 "Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Devices" and CSC 2
            "Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Software." This scenario documents a process
            that is specific to collecting and maintaining hardware and software data attributes for
            vulnerability assessment purposes, but the collection of the hardware attributes and
            software inventory documented in the Endpoint Data Collection section that follows can
            also be used for the purpose of implementing authorized and unauthorized hardware and
            software management processes (e.g., scanning tools looking for unauthorized software).
            Moreover, the ability to accurately identify endpoints and, to a lesser degree,
            applications is integral to effective endpoint data collection and vulnerability
            management.</t>
          <t>The Endpoint Data Collection section does not have coverage for the specific details
            described in CSC 1 and 2 as they are different processes and would be out-of-scope of
            this scenario, but the section does provide the data necessary to support the
            controls.</t>
          <t>The Endpoint Identification and Endpoint Data Collection sections within this scenario
            align with CSC 1-1 and 1-4 by identifying enterprise endpoints and collecting their
            hardware and network attributes. The Endpoint Data Collection section aligns with and
            supports CSC 2-3 and 2-4 by defining a software inventory process and a method of
            obtaining operating system and file system attributes. The rest of the items from CSC 1
            and 2 deal with implementation details and would be out-of-scope for this document.</t>
          <t>CSC 2-9 describes the use of a software ID tag in XML format. SWID tags
            (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_19770) would also be a possible implementation
            for the Endpoint Data Collection section described in this scenario.</t>

    <section title="SACM Usage Scenarios">
      <t>The SACM "Endpoint Security Posture Assessment: Enterprise Use Cases" document (<xref
          target="RFC7632"/>) defines multiple usage scenarios that are meant to provide examples of
        implementing the use cases and building block capabilities. Below is a brief summary of some
        of these usage scenarios and how this document aligns and/or adds additional value to the
        identified usage scenarios.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Automated Checklist Verification (2.2.2) - "An enterprise operates a heterogeneous IT
            environment. They utilize vendor-provided automatable security configuration checklists
            for each operating system and application used within their IT environment. Multiple
            checklists are used from different vendors to ensure adequate coverage of all IT
            assets." The usage scenario, as defined in the RFC, is targeted at the checklist level
            and can be interpreted as being specific to endpoint configuration. There is mention of
            patch assessment and vulnerability mitigation, but the usage scenario could be expanded
            upon by including vulnerability verification. Replacing the idea of a checklist in the
            SACM usage scenario with vulnerability would allow the usage scenario to align almost
            exactly with the scenario described in this document. Instead of collecting automatable
            security configuration checklists, the enterprise would collect automatable
            vulnerability description data available from the vendor as described or possibly from
            other interested third-parties.</t>
          <t>Detection of Posture Deviations (2.2.3) - "An enterprise has established secure
            configuration baselines for each different type of endpoint within their IT environment.
            When an endpoint connects to the network, the appropriate baseline configuration is
            communicated to the endpoint. Once the baseline has been established, the endpoint is
            monitored for any change events pertaining to the baseline on an ongoing basis. When a
            change occurs to posture defined in the baseline, updated posture information is
            exchanged. When the endpoint detects a posture change, an alert is generated identifying
            the specific changes in posture." This usage scenario would support the concept of
            endpoints signaling or alerting the enterprise to changes in the posture relates to
            endpoint vulnerabilities in the same way that it would for configurations. Replacing the
            idea of a checklist with vulnerability description data allows the SACM usage scenario
            and the scenario described in this document to align in their objectives.</t>
          <t>Asynchronous Compliance/Vulnerability Assessment at Ice Station Zebra (2.2.5) - "An
            isolated arctic IT environment that is separated from the main university network. The
            only network communications are via an intermittent, low-speed, high-latency, high-cost
            satellite link. Remote network admins will need to show continued compliance with the
            security policies of the university, the government, and the provider of the satellite
            network, as well as keep current on vulnerability testing." This SACM usage scenario
            describes vulnerability assessment and aligns well with the vulnerability scenario
            described in this document. The endpoint assets are identified and associated data is
            published in a Repository. Vulnerability description data is collected and saved in a
            Repository as it is released. The vulnerability description data is queued for later
            assessment, then the assessment results and vulnerability description data are stored
            after assessment. The only real difference in this SACM usage scenario is the timing of
            the assessments. The scenario described within this document would have no problems
            adjusting to the timing of this SACM usage scenario or anything similar.</t>

    <section title="SACM Requirements and Charter - Future Work">
      <t>In the course authoring this document, some additional considerations for possible future
        work were noted. The following points were taken from the <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-sacm-requirements">SACM Requirements</xref>, <xref
          target="charter-ietf-sacm-01">SACM Charter</xref>, and SACM Use Cases (<xref
          target="RFC7632"/>) documents and represent work that may be necessary to support the
        tasks or goals of SACM going forward.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>The SACM requirements mentions "Result Reporting" with applications but no detail
            around what the assessment results data set should include. In the case of vulnerability
            assessment results, context is important and details beyond just a Pass or Fail result
            are needed in order to take action. A good example of this might be the Priority of the
            vulnerability itself and how many systems it affects within the enterprise. With this in
            mind, it might be worthwhile to investigate a minimum data set or schema for assessment
            results. The concern here is with vulnerability description data, but this could apply
            to other enterprise processes as well.</t>
          <t>The "Human-assigned endpoint attributes" mentioned previously in this scenario are
            touched on in the SACM use cases, but the topic could probably be explored in much more
            depth. Enterprise policy and behaviors could be greatly influenced by endpoint
            attributes such as locations, how the endpoint is used, and criticality. When and how
            these data attributes are collected, as well as what the minimum or common set might
            look like, would be good topics for future related SACM work. In addition, the storage
            of these attributes could be central (stored in a data repository) or they could be
            assigned and stored on the endpoints themselves.</t>

      <section title="Endpoint Identification">
        <t>This sub-step aligns with the Endpoint Discovery, Endpoint Characterization, and Endpoint

          an enterprise network.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Endpoint Data Collection">
        <t>This sub-step aligns with the Data Publication building block capability because this
          section involves storage of endpoint attributes within an enterprise Repository. This
          sub-step also aligns with the Endpoint Characterization and Endpoint Target Identification
          building block capabilities because it further characterizes the endpoint through
          automated and possibly manual means. There is direct alignment with the Endpoint Component
          Inventory, Posture Attribute Identification, and Posture Attribute Value Collection
          building block capabilities since the purpose of this sub-step is to perform an initial
          inventory of the endpoint and collect basic attributes and their values. Last, there is
          alignment with the Collection Guidance Acquisition building block capabilities as the
          inventory and collection of endpoint attributes would be directed by some type of
          enterprise or third-party guidance.</t>
