# SACM Vulnerability Assessment Hackathon Information
This page documents the intent of our SACM hackathon planned for IETF 99, and also functions as the starting point for documenting outcomes from work being tracked in <https://github.com/sacmwg/vulnerability-scenario/projects/1>.


## Goals and Outcomes
Note: The following goals and outcomes pertain to IETF 100.

### Goals
* Have software identification elements and network device elements put into the same `xmpp-grid` broker network from different sources (i.e. PA-TNC, yang push).
* Information pushed through the broker network will be stored in a central repository
* Evaluator uses centrally stored information to determine vulnerability and/or configuration state

### Outcomes
* We identify specific points of orchestration
* We learn more to inform our information model


## User Story

A vendor identifies a vulnerability in their software product being exploited in the wild. The vendor produces a new version of their software and publishes a vulnerability bulletin (Vulnerability Description Information) that advises customers to upgrade to this new version to address the vulnerability. The product versions have both a SWID tag and a CoSWID tag. As a customer using the affected products, we need to build a vulnerability assessment system that is capable of detecting which version of the software is installed and compare that version with the affected versions, so that we know whether we are presently vulnerable. The Collector (or Collectors) will be capable of gathering software inventory information from one or more target endpoints by:

1. Requesting software inventory information for the affected software based on an ad-hoc request.
2. Reporting the software inventory as software changes occur

Collected software inventory information will be stored in an Endpoint Repository and will be compared to Vulnerability Detection Data retrieved from the Vulnerability Detection Data Repository - results will be stored in the Assessment Results Repository. The Vulnerability Detection Data will be derived from the vendor-provided information in some useful way to be determined by the Vulnerability Assessor. (This derivation need not be automatic for the purpose of this exercise.)

## Components and Existing Functionality
The following are the primary components for this hackathon.

* Vulnerability Detection Data Repository (VDD Repository)
* Vulnerability Assessor
* Endpoint Repository
* Collector
* Target Endpoint
* Assessment Results Repository

We will be taking advantage of resources used from our IETF 99 hackathon. The following table provides these details.

| Component | Code Module/Function | Responsible Provider | Code/Component URL | Is SACM Component? |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| VDD Repository | ROLIE Implementation | Stephen Banghart |  | Yes |
| Vulnerability Assessor | CIS-CAT Pro Assessor<br>StrongSwan (??)| Bill Munyan<br>Andreas Steffan |  | Yes |
| Endpoint Repository | StrongSwan | Andreas Steffan | [SWIMA PA-TNC](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/tree/swima) | Yes |
| Collector | StrongSwan<br>CIS-CAT Pro Asseessor | Andreas Steffan<br>Bill Munyan | [SWIMA PA-TNC](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/tree/swima) | Yes |
| Assessment Results Repository | CIS-CAT Pro Dashboard<br>StrongSwan (??) | Bill Munyan<br>Andreas Steffan | | Yes |
| Broker | px-grid broker | Henk Birkholz | N/A | Yes |


The following depicts a what we considered would be a way forward for integrating the two separate efforts from IETF 99. The depiction below shows collection of software identification information from one endpoint using SWIMA (which is software identification over PT-TLS - it's not difficult to imagine other collection types going over PT-TLS). In this case, the SACM Collector are the StrongSWAN and PT-TLS Client working together. Similarly, collection from network equipment (target endpoints A and B in this diagram) may get to some SACM collector using YANG-push. Both SACM collectors could then publish that collected information to some XMPP-Grid Controller, in this case a broker. The endpoint repository of our hackathon effort (StrongTNC) would then receive the information, and our assessor (CIS-CAT Pro in our hackathon effort) would be able to query that information at will, each using the XMPP-Grid approach of disseminating downstream collection information.
